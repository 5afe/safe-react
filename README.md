## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) in our infrastructure, so we decided to go with yarn in the README.
Please install yarn globally if you haven't already.

### Environment variables

The app grabs environment variables from the `.env` file. Copy our template to your own local file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

To execute transactions, you'll need to create an [Infura](https://infura.io) project and set the project ID in the `.env` you've just created:

```
REACT_APP_INFURA_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Once done, you'll need to restart the app if it's already running.

### Installing and running

Install dependencies for the project:

```
yarn install
```

To launch the dev version of the app locally:

```
yarn start
```

Alternatively, to run the production version of the app:

```
yarn build
mv build app
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

And open http://localhost:3000/app in the browser.

### Docker

If you prefer to use Docker:

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

### Building

To get a complete bundle using the current configuration use:

```
yarn build
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests:

```
yarn test
```

### Lint

ESLint will be run automatically before you commit. To run it manually:

```
yarn lint:fix
```

## Deployment

### Dev & staging

The code is deployed to a testing website automatically on each push via a GitHub Action.
The GitHub Action will create a new subdomain and post the link as a comment in the PR.

When pushing to the `main` branch, the code will be automatically deployed to [staging](https://safe-team.staging.gnosisdev.com/).

### Production

Deployment to production is done manually. Please see the [release procedure](docs/release-procedure.md) notes for details.
