## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
yarn add truffle // recommended usage of -g flag
yarn add ganache-cli // recommended usage of -g flag
